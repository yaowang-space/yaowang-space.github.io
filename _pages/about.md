As a student of geology, my research centers on the processes of magmatic evolution and the genetic relationships among minerals and rocks. I am currently focused on the rock records of specific regions, namely the Himalayas and the Sanjiang area. I like employing mathematical and computational approaches to quantitatively unravel the physical and chemical mechanisms underlying geological phenomena.

Building on my regional investigations, I maintain a strong interest in the evolutionary patterns of Earth at a global scale and the corresponding planetary processes, aiming to understand the dynamic behavior of the Earth system from a broader perspective.

I believe that interdisciplinary exchange can inspire innovative ideas. Scholars from diverse fields are warmly welcomed to reach out for discussion and potential research collaboration.

For the quantitative segementation of zircon age plateaus in depth profiling, a simple example is demonstrated in [xxxX], using the methodology presented in [Wang et al., 2026].
