👨‍🎓 Master's Student, China University of Geosciences, Beijing  
🏔️ Research Interest: Geology, Mathematics, and Geochronology

---
### 🔬 Research Focus
My research revolves around **crust and mantle systems**, with key interests in:

* 🌋 **Petrology & Geochronology** – Investigating the evolutionary pathways of the lithosphere.
* 🏔️ **Regional Geology** – Concentrating on the tectonic and magmatic evolution of the Himalayas and Sanjiang regions.
* 🔢 **Computational Geosciences** – Employing mathematical and quantitative approaches to unravel the physical and chemical mechanisms of geological phenomena.

---
### 🌍 Vision
My long-term ambition is to bridge the gap between **Geological Observation** and **Quantitative Modeling**. This vision aims to empower geoscientists to:

* ⚙️ **Quantify uncertainty** in complex geological dating and isotopic systems.
* 🔄 **Integrate multi-scale data** from micro-scale zircon crystals to macro-scale tectonic plates.
* 📚 **Foster interdisciplinary exchange** – Using computational tools to inspire innovative ideas across all Earth science fields.
