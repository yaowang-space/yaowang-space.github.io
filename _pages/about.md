My research focuses on the evolutionary pathways of crust and mantle systems, including petrology and geochronology. My current work is concentrated on the Himalayas and the Sanjiang regions. I like employing mathematical and computational approaches to quantitatively unravel the physical and chemical mechanisms underlying geological phenomena.

I maintain a strong interest in the evolutionary patterns of earth and the planets, wanting to understand the correlation of the planetary system from a broader perspective.

I believe that interdisciplinary exchange can inspire innovative ideas. Welcome scholars from all fields to discussion and collaborate.
